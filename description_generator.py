    - **Within paragraph sections (e.g., About the Company, Internship Overview), bold the important words listed above (e.g., company name, skills, keywords) using <b> tags to make them stand out. Do NOT bold words within <ul> lists, as they are already highlighted as bullet points.**
    - Ensure the response is at least {word_count} words. Expand each section thoughtfully with relevant details, examples, subpoints, and insights to reach the minimum word count, but do NOT add new sections or fields.
    - Make the tone and wording fit the nature of the role (e.g., formal for full-time, friendly for internships).
    - Do not add Package, Last Date to apply, and vacancies unless explicitly specified in the format.
